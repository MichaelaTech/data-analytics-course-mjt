# Module 7: Choose Your Adventure 

This week is "Choose Your Adventure" week where you go deeper on a topic of your choice - either Data Visualization, SQL, BI tooling, Excel or Google Sheets, or even trying your hand at Python or R if you are interested! Using our class format  - find a series of video lessons and watch and complete them. Then choose a data set and analyze it in your prefered tool, leveraging the video lesson you watched to complete the assignment. 

# Video Lessons: 

- [x] Curate the videos you watched for your topic of choice and add here under "Video Lessons".
